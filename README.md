1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Look in the pet model class - there are 4 requested methods and a bonus.
3. Finish the methods
4. `git add .`, `git commit -m "finished"`, and `git push`
5. Submit a pull request and assign me as a reviewer

Note that this practice is just with model methods - there is not a working Sinatra app here - no controllers, routes, etc.
